    "1.  **Why** and **How** to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **Sweetviz** (Automated EDA).\n",
    "2.  **Why** and **How** to clean data efficiently using **Pyjanitor**.\n",
    "3.  **Why** and **How** to select the most predictive features using **Polars** and **XGBoost**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"SOTA\" Stack:\n",
    "*   **Polars**: A lightning-fast DataFrame library (faster and more memory-efficient than Pandas).\n",
