# Machine Learning Feature Selection — SOTA EDA & Cleaning

A didactic Colab-ready tutorial demonstrating SOTA exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning, and feature selection for tabular datasets using Polars, Sweetviz, Pyjanitor, and XGBoost.

This repository contains:

- `tutorial_eda_feature_selection.ipynb` — A progressive Google Colab notebook that walks you through dataset download, EDA, cleaning, and feature selection with explanations and runnable cells.

Why this repo:

- Designed for Kaggle-style tabular problems (100MB–5GB)
- Uses fast, modern tooling: `polars` for performance, `sweetviz` for automated EDA, `pyjanitor` for clean transforms, and `xgboost` for embedded feature selection.

Quick Start (local or Colab)

1. Open the notebook in VS Code or upload it to Google Colab. The notebook includes an "Open in Colab" badge.
2. Run the first cell to install dependencies, then run cells sequentially.

Dependencies

- `polars`
- `pandas`
- `sweetviz`
- `pyjanitor`
- `xgboost`
- `scikit-learn`

(You can install them in Colab with the notebook's first cell.)
