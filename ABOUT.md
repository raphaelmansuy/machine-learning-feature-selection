About this project

Author: Raphael Mansuy

Purpose: Provide a clear, step-by-step Colab tutorial for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and feature selection using modern, high-performance Python libraries suited to medium-sized tabular datasets. The notebook is intentionally didactic and progressive so beginners and intermediate practitioners can follow and apply the same workflow to their own datasets.

Notes:
- The notebook is Colab-ready: it includes an "Open in Colab" badge and uses pip installs at the top for reproducibility.
- If you want the repo private or need a different name, adjust before pushing.
